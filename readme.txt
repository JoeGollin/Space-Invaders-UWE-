Current Issues

Game Mode:

Normal: None

Gravity: None (it's a bit bad, but it works)

Quadratic: Middle of curve is set at 0,0, I don't know how to change this to be base of the centre of the X - must be an offset somewhere

Sine: Doesn't want to move down on border collision - not sure on this one
